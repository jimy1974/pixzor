Certainly! Let's break down the requirements and think through the design for implementing voxel extrusion and removal using mouse dragging. Here's a plan to address each of the points you mentioned.

High-Level Design
Record the Initial Mouse Click Position:

Capture the initial position when the left mouse button is first pressed.
Determine Mouse Movement Direction:

Calculate the movement direction of the mouse in 2D screen space.
Determine if the movement is in the same direction as the 3D raycast normal.
Calculate Distance and Voxel Layers:

Calculate the distance the mouse has moved from its initial position.
Convert this distance to the number of voxel layers to add or remove.
Dynamic Mesh Creation:

Create a temporary, semi-transparent mesh to visualize the potential voxel changes.
Only finalize the changes when the mouse button is released.
Detailed Plan
Step 1: Record the Initial Mouse Click Position
Mouse Callback Function:
Modify the mouse_callback function to store the initial mouse position (initialMousePos) when the left mouse button is first pressed.
Store the initial voxel position and the face that was clicked.
Step 2: Determine Mouse Movement Direction
Mouse Movement Calculation:
Continuously track the current mouse position while the left button is held down.
Calculate the direction vector of the mouse movement in screen space.
Compare this direction with the 2D projection of the 3D raycast normal to determine if it's moving inward or outward.
Step 3: Calculate Distance and Voxel Layers
Distance Calculation:
Calculate the Euclidean distance between the initial mouse position and the current mouse position.
Convert this distance into a number of voxel layers to add or remove.
Step 4: Dynamic Mesh Creation
Temporary Mesh:
Use the ExtrusionManager to create a temporary mesh that visualizes the potential voxel changes.
The mesh should be semi-transparent to indicate that it's a preview.
Only apply the changes to the voxel world when the left mouse button is released.
Implementation Strategy
Data Structures and Methods
VoxelWorld Class:

Add methods to temporarily add or remove voxels and generate a preview mesh.
ExtrusionManager Class:

Manage the state of the extrusion, including the initial click position, direction, and distance.
Generate the temporary mesh based on the mouse movement.
Workflow
Initial Mouse Click:

Capture the initial mouse position and raycast normal.
Initialize the ExtrusionManager with this information.
Mouse Movement:

Continuously update the current mouse position.
Calculate the movement direction and distance.
Determine the number of voxel layers to add or remove based on the movement.
Temporary Mesh Update:

Generate a temporary mesh to visualize the changes.
Update this mesh dynamically as the mouse moves.
Finalization:

When the mouse button is released, apply the voxel changes to the VoxelWorld.
Clear the temporary mesh.
Potential Challenges and Solutions
Performance:

Generating a new mesh for every mouse movement can be slow. Optimize by only updating the necessary parts of the mesh.
Use spatial partitioning (e.g., octrees) to manage and update only relevant sections of the voxel world.
Precision:

Ensure the mouse movement accurately maps to voxel layers. Consider snapping to voxel grid to avoid small, imprecise changes.
User Feedback:

Provide visual feedback through a semi-transparent preview mesh.
Consider adding additional visual cues, such as grid lines or bounding boxes.
Conclusion
By structuring the implementation this way, we can handle complex voxel operations efficiently and intuitively. Using an ExtrusionManager to handle the state and a temporary mesh for visualization allows for a responsive and user-friendly interface. This approach also ensures that the voxel world isn't unnecessarily modified until the user confirms the changes by releasing the mouse button.
